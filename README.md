## Shapes Photo Album
A photo-album program that works as a painting canvas for drawing images with shapes, and which takes
snapshots of said “drawings”, and renders them to user in the form of a scrollable **HTML** album or **SWING** based view with 
image toggle and selecting functionality.

This project was developed with **MODEL-VIEW-CONTROLLER** design pattern and relies extensively on an 
**OBJECT-ORIENTED DESIGN** to facilitate the implementations of each program component. The program was delivered based on a rubric,
and all classes and elements of the model were tested extensively using **JUNIT**.
